what is SAP BODS
development->from source getting info converted into format that is useful for client
runtime->to excute at what time
managementt organising the way of execution

is a graphical user interface developed information to built complex data
data inegration

dat quility
  
data profiling

BOD ->business object dATA service

data migration ->take the infromation from one source put it into data source

Data warehousing ->easy data analysis and reporting

B I -> applied ro analyze data perform function.
  It require to do coding and 

concept of reporting related to ETL tools->which resource , how much sales they made,how much 
revenue they are making  its report is best when it comes from ETL
  Data Service Components

Applying query  
The idea 

seperate solution   various data sources
for reporting which tool is using like SAP ,
tableau ->extract information from datawarehousing it goes to frequent 

BODS IS VERY BEST ETL TOOL

DESIGNER   WHAT U MADE lime code done in bods software SIT ON RESPOSITORY.

MUTIPLE USER DEVELOP MULTIPLE OBJECT AT SAME TIMES.

  -  DESIGNER  - you are basically using this for ETL. its a software application 
for developing console.

 ->REPOSITORY  LOCAL MEANS DOING IN OWN SYSTEM  . 
   CENTRAL ANYONE CAN USE AND DOWNLOAD AND USE IT
 where u kept evrything. central management can also develop but its easy to be done by 
designer

Job server - > everyone done , its like machine job we are developing run from  .  you r doing in local r  it must be point to 
job server. whatever u done or run from job server.whatever job u want to execute is done through job server

   - > Engine  - its like a way who are running the job server
  

   Access server -. pass message b/w w app and data service job server.  REal time
central management-   used for scheduling job and user management
  whatever work is doing can be happened through central management console.
web interface whatever query u run past .
  
  SAP BODS Architecture

     

  Object
object means whatever present inside designer. 
  properties   / options
types of object  -  single use object  /   reusable object
